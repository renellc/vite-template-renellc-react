# vite-template-renellc-react

This is a custom template that I personally use when starting new React SPA projects. This is based on Vite's React + Typescript + SWC template but differs in the following ways:

- Uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting instead of ESLint and Prettier
- Adds [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) as a routing solution
